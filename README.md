Project and README file were created on 13th October, 2021.

### Project Title
Bikeshare project

### Description
Explore a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I will run a comparison with the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Files used
The original files are much larger but they can be accessed here if you'd like to see them 
([Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data), [New York City](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), [Washington](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)). These files had more columns and they differed in format in many cases. Some [data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) has been performed to condense these files to the above core six columns
